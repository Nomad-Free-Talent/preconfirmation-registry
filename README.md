# Preconfirmation Registry

## Overview

The Preconfirmation Registry is a smart contract designed to manage the registration and collateral of proposers in a credibly neutral and permissionless manner. It allows proposers to register with ETH collateral, delegate to other proposers, and handles penalties for misbehavior. The registry also supports leader election based on the Ethereum lookahead.

Key features:
- Registration with pure ETH collateral
- Delegation of collateral to multiple proposers
- Penalty application based on customizable conditions
- Leader election for preconfirmation
- Withdrawal process with cooldown period
